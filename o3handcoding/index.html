    <h1>About Our Crew</h1>
    <h2>All Our Drama</h2>
    <p>Decal Drama started in the basement of our family home. Our kids wanted to learn more about the free enterprise system which has made America great. 

    <p>Our kids are fourth generation sign makers. Great-Grandpa Gene taught Grandpa to hand-letter signs in the 1960’s. Mom started designing signs at age 14 and Dad joined the family business building big, lighted, building and pole signs and graphics. So, when selecting a business for our children, we chose to continue the family legacy.</p>

    <p>We learned online marketing putting up our products on multiple stores, finally creating an <a href="https://decaldrama.com/" target="_blank">independent website store</a>. Over the years our business has grown and developed with our family. As we worked we have grown closer and we realized we wanted to live the American Dream instead of chasing it. We loaded up in our family RV, selling all our excess and simplifying our life. Thus allowing us to travel around the country visiting with our customers at local events. Our family loves meeting with our fans and discussing their ideas for new designs. We use only the highest quality sign-grade materials to create our designs. We love creating the perfect manifestation of our client’s ideas.</p>
    

    <p>Come into our site. Peruse the designs, we happily accommodate custom requests. In fact, we encourage them: no size or shape is too outrageous. We strive for your <a href="featured.html#guarantee">satisfaction,</a> please let us know how we can improve your experience. We are proud of our designs and love what we do. We welcome you to join us on this journey.</p>
